# Mission_to_Mars_Challenge
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to further develop the web app for Robin, in order to include images of Mars and its hemispheres. We utilized BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres, along with a breif description. Then, we stored the scraped data on a Mongo database and used a web application to display the data. We also made sure that the web app would also work on mobile devices.
